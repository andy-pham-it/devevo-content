# Soft Skills Interview Guide 🤝

Mid-level and Senior interviews are 50% technical and 50% behavioral. You can fail a tech interview if you are a "jerk," but you can pass with mediocre code if you are a great communicator.

## 1. The STAR Method (Golden Rule)
Use this structure for ALL behavioral questions ("Tell me about a time...").

-   **S - Situation**: Set the context. Be brief. *"In my previous role at XYZ, we faced a critical database outage during Black Friday."*
-   **T - Task**: What was your specific responsibility? *"My task was to identify the root cause and restore service while communicating with stakeholders."*
-   **A - Action**: What did **YOU** do? (Focus on "I", not "We"). *"I analyzed the slow query log, identified a missing index, and deployed a hotfix. I also set up a replica to offload traffic."*
-   **R - Result**: The outcome. Use numbers! *"The system recovered in 15 mins. Post-fix, latancy dropped by 40%. We prevented ~50k lost sales."*

## 2. Common Questions & Winning Answers

### "Tell me about yourself"
Do not read your CV. Tell a story (Past -> Present -> Future).
*   **Past**: "I started as a web dev 5 years ago, loving React..."
*   **Present**: "Currently at [Company], I lead the mobile team, focusing on performance..."
*   **Future**: "I'm looking to move into FinTech because I love high-concurrency challenges, which is why I applied here."

### "What is your greatest weakness?"
Do not say "I'm a perfectionist" or "I work too hard" (Fake weaknesses).
**Formula**: Real weakness + Steps taken to fix it + Current status.
*   *Example*: "I used to struggle with public speaking/presenting technical ideas. To fix this, I volunteered to run the weekly demo meeting. It was scary at first, but now I'm comfortable presenting to 20+ people and it improved my communication skills."

### "Tell me about a conflict with a coworker"
**Goal**: Show maturity and conflict resolution (Win-Win).
*   *Story*: "A backend dev and I disagreed on the API usage. He wanted one large endpoint; I wanted granular ones."
*   *Action*: "Instead of arguing, I set up a meeting to understand his constraints (DB load). I explained my constraints (Mobile battery/data). We compromised on a GraphQL approach."
*   *Result*: "The feature shipped on time, and our relationship improved because we understood each other's domain better."

## 3. Questions to Ask the Interviewer (Reverse Interview)
Asking good questions makes you look senior and engaged.

**For Engineering Managers:**
-   "What is the biggest technical debt currently slowing the team down?"
-   "How does the team balance new features vs maintenance?"
-   "What does success look like in the first 90 days?"

**For Developers:**
-   "What do you like most and least about the code base?"
-   "How is the on-call rotation handled? Is it stressful?"
-   "Can you walk me through the deployment pipeline?"

## 4. Red Flags to Watch Out For 🚩
-   "We work hard and play hard" usually means lots of unpaid overtime.
-   "We are like a family" can mean lack of professional boundaries.
-   Interviewer is late, rude, or checks phone during interview.
-   No clear answer on "Why is this position open?" (Is it high turnover?).
